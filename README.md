# anger-prototype-study
The present study adopts a prototype approach (Russell & Fehr, 1994; Shaver et al., 1987) to investigate the differences between justified and unjustified anger in terms of established dimensions relevant to moral, emotional, and relational experiences. Following a prototype approach, participants first write about their experience of justified or unjustified anger. Next, they are instructed to complete a series of questionnaires designed to evaluate various theoretically relevant aspects of the anger event they had described. 
The overarching goal of this study is to provide a multi-dimensional comparison of justified and unjustified anger. These dimensions fall under four broad categories. Informed by the literature, a series of research questions and hypotheses have been developed will be examined (as described in the preregistration document) to provide a more granular understanding of each of these two anger variants.
